Purpose of this test

	The purpose of this test is to help define the performance
	characteristics of target languages in the task of reading,
	writing, and searching ("does key exist?") in a hashmap.

Method

	A static array (of whatever type is standard for that language)
	is pre-populated with X strings consisting of Y randomly
	generated integers (0-9) each. X and Y are specified in the
	Makefile as TESTSIZE and STRINGSIZE. All languages will use the same
	list of strings, and will begin execution with the list in
	memory, so that file I/O is not a consideration.

Measurements

	The execution time for the entire loop will be counted. The
	benchmark will not begin until the initialization of the loop,
	and will stop immediately after the last iteration of the loop.

	The tests will produce timing to millisecond precision, fractional
	milliseconds are not necessary.
